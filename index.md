Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/en/Home" target="_blank">Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica</a>. I was previously at the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/linguistics/homepage.html" target="_blank">Department of Linguistics</a>, New York University, where I received my PhD in September, 2020. My dissertation “Feature systems, inventory structures, and phonological classes” was supervised by <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/gilliangallagher/" target="_blank">Gillian Gallagher</a>.

<br />

I am interested in the relationship between speech perception and phonotactics, as well as the typology of phonemic contrasts and inventories. Nasal segments are a recurring theme in my current research. In addition to phonetics and phonology, I also have an interest in natural language processing (NLP), especially in the application of NLP and machine learning tools in answering questions in linguistics.

<br />

Before coming to NYU, my research focused on the phonetics of discourse-level prosody in spontaneous speech in Taiwanese (Taiwan Southern Min), and I still have related research interests in tone sandhi and tonogenesis.
