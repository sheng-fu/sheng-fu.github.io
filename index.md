Welcome! I am an assistant research fellow at the <a href="https://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/main/en" target="_blank">Institute of Linguistics</a>, Academia Sinica. I was previously at the <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/linguistics/homepage.html" target="_blank">Department of Linguistics</a>, New York University, where I received my PhD in September, 2020. My dissertation “Feature systems, inventory structures, and phonological classes” was supervised by <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/gilliangallagher/" target="_blank">Gillian Gallagher</a>.

<br />

My research interests in phonetics and phonology include the interaction between prosody and predictability, phonotactics, and the typology of phonemic contrasts and inventories. My works in phonetics mostly focus on Taiwanese.

<br />

I also work in the field of natural language processing (NLP), especially in the application of NLP and machine learning tools in answering questions in linguistics. I am also interested in the evaluation of neural network models using linguistic tasks.
